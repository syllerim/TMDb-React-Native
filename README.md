React-Native app based on the TMDb API

In this application you will find on the main view the different types of Genre for Movies.  When you select a Genre you will see the list of movies under this category, with the possibility to see more details about an specific movie and the template for creating a new movie, without persistance on server.

These are the screens you will find when running the app on an iOS Device.
